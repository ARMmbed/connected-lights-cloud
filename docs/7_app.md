### Bringing it all together

Youâ€™ve already built almost all of the pieces required for the lighting system. You now have:

* The circuitry.
* The firmware.
* A connection to mbed Cloud.
* A way of talking from a Node.js or Python app to the device.

You can now combine everything by building a web app that allows you to control the lights from anywhere in the world. For convenience, we built a Node.js mobile web app for you, which is here: [ARMmbed/connected-lights-cloud](https://github.com/ARMmbed/connected-lights-cloud/tree/master/webapp). The web app has the following features:

* Lists all the lights under your account.
* Changes the status of the light (from motion sensing to on/off).
* Quickly changes colors.
* Gets notifications whenever the PIR sensor detects movement.

Here is a screenshot of the app running on an Android phone:

*This is what the mobile interface looks like with two lights connected. Tap the color to change it.*

<span class="notes">**Note:** To give the lights a more friendly name (such as "living room"), change the name of the device in the mbed Cloud Portal.</notes>

#### Installing the application

To start the application, first download the application, either by:

1. Downloading the [application as a ZIP archive](https://github.com/ARMmbed/connected-lights-cloud/archive/master.zip).
1. Or running `git clone https://github.com/armmbed/connected-lights-cloud` in your terminal.

Then, open `main.js`, and paste your mbed Cloud API key in the first line. Next, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the location where you extracted the application and run:

```
$ cd connected-lights-cloud/webapp
$ npm install
$ node main.js
```

Open your web browser, and go to http://localhost:5265 to see the application running.

#### Konekuta

The web application is built on top of [Konekuta](https://github.com/armmbed/konekuta/tree/cloud), a framework for building dynamic web applications on top of mbed Cloud. Konekuta solves a number of common problems with building connected applications, including state syncing, going offline/online, handling errors and updating the UI when devices connect or disconnect from mbed Cloud. Konekuta is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/armmbed/konekuta/tree/cloud).
